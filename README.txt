This is a small pet project to find the best options limited by weight for the nominal logistics company to add to the transpor order.
The first step is to enter a weight limit using an integer number.
The second and the last step is to enter a line of data using "product_name/weight/price." format.
As an output to the console you will get a list of product names divided by whitespace with their cumulative price.
